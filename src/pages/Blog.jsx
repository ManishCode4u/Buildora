Artificial Intelligence, commonly called AI, is a technology that allows machines and computer systems to think, learn, and take decisions in a human-like manner. Unlike traditional programs that work only on fixed instructions, AI systems analyze large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and improve their performance over time. Artificial Intelligence is no longer a concept of the future; it is already deeply integrated into our everyday lives, often without us realizing it.
